## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow (Responsive website)

### What I learned

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
<div class="">
  <div id=""></div>
</div>
<a href=""></a>
<p></p>
<img src="" alt="">
<ol>
  <li></li>
</ol>
<ul>
  <li></li>
</ul>
<hr>
```
```css
li::marker {
  color: hsl(14, 45%, 36%);
}
@media only screen and (max-width: 375px) {
  .page {
    width: 100%;
  }
}
```

### Continued development

I just want to continue improving my css skill and be better each time, till i become a proper professional web development.

### Useful resources

- [https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_bullet_color.asp](https://www.example.com) - This helped me for add color to the bullet of the ul and ol element of my recipe page. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_responsive.asp](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand web responsive design. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
